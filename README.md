# Full Stack Project Working
## Login is done after which jwt token gets stored inside localstorage if account doesn't exists then register to create an account
## Logout removes the set jwt data of localstorage and gets log out
## After logging in emails will be retrieved then if we select any bar then full detail of that email will be shown
## I am polling to the api to generate an email
## If a user opens his email we can see it
